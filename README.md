## Features

- **Spotlight-like quick launcher**

PowerToys brings a macOS Spotlight functionality to Windows with PowerToys Run. It allows users to quickly search for files, applications, and settings on your system. 

By pressing a customizable hotkey combination, a search bar appears, enabling users to type their query and quickly launch or access the desired item without navigating through menus or directories. Besides PowerToys Run, this utility allows for many OS customizations, like *FancyZones, Always On Top, Peek, File Explorer add-ons, Color Picker and Find My Mouse*, improving your workflow in many different ways.

- **Dock**

Winstep Nexus is a highly customizable and feature-rich dock application for Windows that can be used to achieve a macOS-like dock experience. It offers a wide range of customization options, including different themes, icons, and animations.

By integrating WinStep Nexus into your WinMac modification, you can provide users with a visually appealing and functional dock that resembles the macOS style. This will enhance the overall user experience and make the transition between Windows and macOS seamless.

- **Revamped and decluttered Start Menu**

Open-Shell is a collection of os customization utilities, that allows to bring a customizable Start Menu replacement for Windows, to completely replace traditional Start Menu with customized WinX menu, to resemble MacOS main menu. 

It's accessible from both left and right mouse click on Start menu orb, as well as Win key.

- **Enhanced Taskbar**

StartAllBack enhances the functionality of the Windows Taskbar by introducing features inspired by earlier versions of Windows, such as Windows 7 and Windows 10. It brings back familiar elements like colored title bars and customizable Start buttons. 

Additionally, StartAllBack offers options for customizing the appearance and behavior of the Taskbar to suit individual user preferences.

- **Enhanced Explorer**

StartAllBack extends its enhancements beyond the Taskbar to the Windows Explorer, providing users with a more streamlined and efficient file browsing experience, by bringing back older versions of Explorer from Windows 7 or Windows 10. 

Utility introduces features such as ribbons, tabs, customizable toolbar buttons, enhanced file previews, and improved navigation options. With StartAllBack and PowerToys, you can personalize your Explorer interface to better suit your workflow and access files and folders more efficiently.

Additionally, deployment script includes pinning User folder and Start Menu\Programs folder to Quick Access.

- **Enhanced Terminal**

WinMac provides you with debloated prompt with addition of completion functions and most commonly used commands in macOS/Linux, like *vim, grep, touch, ditto, top, whatis, killall, ll, la, tree* with additional commands like *history, comuterinfo, battery, backup, ntop, rcopy, brew* among ton of other functions!

Please be informed that this is a beta version - you're deploying it at your own risk!!

## Recommendations

For the most reliable deployment process, I recommend to install latest version of [Powershell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) and run *install.ps1* script from the script directory and run it as an Administrator. Everything else (except dock, which must be run separately in non-elevated pwsh session) will be deployed automatically for you (including Winget if not already installed).

## Planned features

- Tasklist object to resemble top-level menus of macOS menu bar,
- Modern UI theme,
- more Dock customization,
- more functions.
