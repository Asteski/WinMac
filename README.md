# Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For the most reliable deployment process, I recommend to check [Installation Guide Wiki](https://github.com/Asteski/WinMac/wiki/Installation-Guide) page.

EasyLauncher batch script allows the installer to be run as a GUI or in a terminal to make the installation and configuration process simple and straightforward.

You can choose between full or custom installation, if you only want to install specific WinMac components.

WinMac is supported by Windows 11, on both x64 and ARM based platforms.

You can also install WinMac on Windows 10 22H2+, with some caveats described [here](https://github.com/Asteski/WinMac/wiki/Windows-10).

Please support creators however you can for their wonderful work!

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that StartAllBack is not a free software and requires license to run permanently. Free version will stop working after 100 days.

WinMac is not planned to be used for business/earning purposes. If you're not okay with me using your software by installing it (using Winget) with Powershell deployment script, please let me know.

Enjoy and support my work by giving feedback and contributing to the project!
