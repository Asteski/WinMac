## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For the most reliable deployment process, I recommend to check [Installation Guide Wiki](https://github.com/Asteski/WinMac/wiki/Installation-Guide) page.

EasyLauncher batch script allows the installer to be run as a GUI or in a terminal to make the installation and configuration process simple and straightforward.

Here are the ways you can run different deployment mods:

- *EasyLauncher.bat* runs installation GUI by default
- *EasyLayncher.bat -nogui* or *-n* runs installer fully in terminal
- *EasyLayncher.bat -uninstall* or *-u* runs uninstallation GUI
- *EasyLayncher.bat -uninstallnogui* or *-un* runs uninstaller fully in terminal

> [!CAUTION]
> You must run batch file in Admin session to ensure reliable installation/unintallation process! 

You can choose between full or custom installation, if you only want to install specific WinMac components.

WinMac is supported by Windows 11, on both x64 and ARM based platforms.

You can also install WinMac on Windows 10 22H2+, with some caveats described [here](https://github.com/Asteski/WinMac/wiki/Windows-10).
