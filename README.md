## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Prior to installing WinMac, it is strongly recommended that you read [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Asteski/WinMac/wiki/Installation-Guide) Wiki page for comprehensive guidance.**

EasyLauncher batch script allows the installer to be run as a GUI or in a Terminal to make the installation and configuration process simple and straightforward.

Here are the ways you can run different deployment mods:

- *EasyLauncher.bat* runs installation GUI by default
- *EasyLauncher.bat -nogui* or *-n* runs installer fully in Terminal
- *EasyLauncher.bat -uninstall* or *-u* runs uninstallation GUI
- *EasyLauncher.bat -uninstallnogui* or *-un* runs uninstaller fully in Terminal

> [!CAUTION]
> **You must run batch file in Administrative session of PowerShell 7, not Windows PowerShell!**

You can choose between full or custom installation, if you only want to install specific WinMac components.

WinMac is supported by Windows 11 Home, Pro, LTSC, IoT LTSC, on both x86 and ARM based platforms.

- enforce dark theme on legacy Windows components
- more Quick Launcher and Start Menu choices
- disable keyboard shortcuts for full-screen apps & add more keyboard shortcuts
- more Windhawk mods
- additional *Start Orbs* and *Icons Packs*, incl. red and green colored folders
